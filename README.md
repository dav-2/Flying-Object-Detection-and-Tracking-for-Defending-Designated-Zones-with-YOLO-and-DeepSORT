# Flying-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-for-Defending-Designated-Zones-with-YOLO-and-DeepSORT

This demo project focuses on developing an AI-powered system designed to detect, track, and classify flying objects in real time, with the primary goal of defending a designated Region of Interest (ROI) from a specific type of object—in this example, birds. By combining deep learning models and tracking algorithms, the system processes video feeds to differentiate between target objects (birds) and non-target objects (such as aircraft).

The system's core objective is to monitor and respond to specific objects entering the ROI while ignoring others, ensuring a targeted and efficient defense mechanism that can be adapted to various contexts. It leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) for tracking across frames.

🚀 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:

𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠  
Detects and tracks specific objects in real time, distinguishing them from other non-relevant objects.   
𝐍𝐨𝐧-𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐍𝐨𝐧-𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐬  
Identifies non-target objects without tracking or interacting with them, allowing resources to focus on the designated threat.  
𝐑𝐎𝐈-𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐞  
Triggers specific responses when the target object enters the ROI. For a playful experience, the system “feeds” birds with virtual peanuts in a hostile manner, creating a fun, game-like interaction.
